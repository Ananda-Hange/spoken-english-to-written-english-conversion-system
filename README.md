### Here are some possible future functionalities that can be covered in the future versions of the module:
1. Contact number must be all numbers without comma. Like input: My contact number contains double 5, quadruple 8, single 9 and triple 4. Output must be:  My contact number contains 5588889444.

2. We can also include other countries currency like rupee, pounds etc.

3. If the paragraph contains a money figure e.g. two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty-four then we may convert it to numbers as 2003984.
